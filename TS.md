# Why use TypeScript?

- As our application grows the code becomes more complex, and 
it's harder to add new features into the existing system. 
- Why a typed system is beneficial: focus on Terran
  - People are confused about the shape of the data from Redux
  - People are unsure whether a variable called `build` is an object, a build id or something else that was named 3 years ago and has nothing to do with the builds in the system. Wouldn't it be nice if you could know which was which without console logging everything or tracing it all the way through the system?

## Talking Points
  Value Proposition for a Typed System for Developers 
  - The self documenting nature of the code 

  Value Proposition for a Typed System for Business People
  - Keeping the code base simple, thus lowering development time and cost.  

  - We reduce the bottom line of dev costs by reducing bugs by naming things consitently throughout the system so that they're easier to define and debug.
